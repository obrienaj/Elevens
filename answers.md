Buggy1:
deal() method
The statement "size--;" is likely either omitted or misplaced below the return statement.

Buggy2:
Deck constructor
The < could have been replaced with a > in the for loop, which would prevent the loop from executing.

Buggy3:
shuffle() method
The > in the for loop could have been replaced with a <, which would prevent the loop from executing and the decks from shuffling.

Buggy4:
deal() method
The if statement isEmpty() could have been replaced with !isEmpty().
