1. 5 spades + 6 clubs or 5 clubs + 6 clubs
2. Yes: there are an even number of cards of ranks A-10. If the last 3 cards aren't a J-Q-K pair, then there is one more 2-pair to be made, after which there would only be 1 card left without a pair, which isn't possible in Elevens. Therefore the last 3 cards must be one 3-pair.
3. There is no strategy in Elevens. If multiple plays are possible, they can be executed in any order without changing the result of the game. Each card can only be used in one specific 2- or 3-pair, so removing a card and its pair(s) does not destroy any other possible moves (unless there is more than one card with the same rank, but suit doesn't matter, it doesn't matter which card is selected and which is left on the board). The same cards will be dealt to the board regardless of which pairs are removed in what order.
